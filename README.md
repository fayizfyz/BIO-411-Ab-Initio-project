# BIO-411-Ab-Initio-project

This repository contains our solutions and work related to a project focused on the **ab initio** method. 

The challenge: You have discovered a new species and extracted its DNA. After sequencing, you identified a novel, previously uncharacterized DNA segment (`$unknown_sequence.fna`). The objective is to functionally annotate this sequence using **ab initio** approaches, strictly avoiding any homology-based methods.
